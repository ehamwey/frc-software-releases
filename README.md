## Team 174: Arctic Warriors (Java/Command-Based)

> * Java simulator - Unobtrusive "simulator" that can be used with any teams java code. It sounds like we took a similar approach to what team 254 did
> * Custom SmartDashboard widgets - Custom widgets to show robot state, motion profiling state, and our autonomous editor
> * Autonomous Scripting - Command based autonomous scripts. Stored as text files on the robot, can be edited from the SmartDashboard
> * Motion Profiling - I had my students hand roll a simple version for straight paths. We also took team 254's spline library as is.

> In developing our software this year, we tried to have a more structured design process. We made a design notebook for our entire robot which will be released at a later date, including class diagrams and sequence diagram. We used the Agile methodology to develop our software, which worked quite well with the structure of a FIRST season and our constantly changing requirements

## Team 225: TechFire (Java/Command-Based)

> * robot.commands.drivetrain.FireDrive: This is a drivetrain control command that allows our mecanum drive to behave like a true omnidirectional drive for driving purposes. That is, FireDrive makes the robot move in all directions with the same speed, instead of the traditional behavior for mecanum: full speed forwards and 50% strafe. However, with our ever changing strategy we decided to remove FireDrive in the offseason in favor of maximum speed, so it is commented out.
> * robot.commands.drivetrain.StableMode: This command uses a sine function to have the drivetrain compensate for the forward and backward motion of our arm as it moves up and down on its circular path. It ended up not being needed in our strategy so it is not tuned to work perfectly.
> * robot.JedisProvider: We originally had the Raspberry Pi on Pheonix running a redis server and using the values from that to serve up our custom HTML and node.js dashboard.
> * SimpleTableServer: This the custom dashboard implementation that we switched to. It uses UDP packets to communicate the values to the Pi.
> * We also have some motion profiling implemented; robot.commands.drivetrain.ProfiledDriveDistance works well and accurately moves the robot a specified number of feet with a maximum acceleration and velocity in either a triangular or trapezoidal motion profile. The other "profiled" commands need work.

> As our robot code approaches its zenith, I wanted to share it with the Chief Delphi community for people to learn from, possibly to get suggestions, and to show the world how the Simple Machines works.

## Team 488: Xbot (Java/Command-Based)

> Our code release comes in two parts: Our 2015 code, and the library we began to construct out of it.

> We put a large focus on testability via injection. This has been the biggest benefit so far - given that our programming team can range between 3-8 members, there's a lot of contention to test things on the actual machine (which may or may not be ready for weeks regardless!). 

> One quick disclaimer for the CommonLib and RobotTemplate (which you'll see on the repository): 
 This repository is still very much a work in progress! There are chunks of code and build steps missing here that would probably block you from directly integrating this into your robot.
 
 > It's getting more complete every week, but as it stands, we recommend that you use parts of this repository rather than the whole of it - taking individual classes, or using the design as inspiration, rather than seeing it as a stable platform for robot development.

It also contains our offseason RGB lights code.

>  We experimented with Feed Forward and Motion Profiling in the fall. With some tuning, I was able to get our 2015 bot and a kitbot to go any distance I wanted without encoders (within an inch or two). I am still working on the integration with Feedback to make it more accurate and the latest code will be available on Github. This project may not be able to be opened until Kickoff because older versions of LabVIEW do not support projects built under Beta.

## Team 1410: The Kraken (C++/Command-Based)

> You may notice two weird things. The first is the array and method at the top of the OI. These are used to add a dead-zone into the controller, making them less sensitive. The second would be the SimultaneousOp CommandGroups in the IntakeArms and CanManipulator Commands folders. These are used so that we can both drive the rollers/arms, and the elevator/arms simultaneously. We could have had a command for this, but by using a command group we can also use the separate commands outside of it.

> One other thing that helped: multi-layered autonomous modes. Some of our modes would pick up totes.

> * ParameterCommand - allows Commands to have parameters that can be set from the SmartDashboard.
> * State machines to control other robot subsystems.
> * Semi-functional driver for the ITG3200 gyro (we didn't use it).
> * Slider - a simple slider control, something that is missing from the built in widgets.
> * ParameterCommand - widget that displays the parameters from a ParameterCommand on the robot
> * WheelController - Used in conjunction with our drive code to display throttle, current and other values from our motors.
> * VideoServer - allows for streaming of any OpenCV image over http as an mjpg. It could probably use some improvement, but it works okay.

> Of note in this code is our autonomous play infrastructure which is described in the attached document. In summary, the infrastructure uses parameterized commands to develop autonomous plays. Once the basic commands are created, no further modifications to robot code are needed. An external labview application runs on a separate laptop or the driver station laptop. This application connects to the robot and reads the available commands. You then build plays using the commands and adding values for the parameters. Commands can be run sequentially or indicated to be run concurrently. Each play is a separate file stored on the robot which can then be selected from a pulldown menu in the DS. Plays can be rapidly modified and rerun (like on a practice field) because no code deployment is needed.

We accomplish this by extending IterativeRobot.class (ours is IterativeRobotCustom) and not executing the line that tells the FMS the code has started (FRC.ObserveUserProgramStarting()) until we receive a user's click on a smart dashboard item.

> Also, the 2015 code will crash the code (throws an exception) if the driver's joystick calibrates improperly. When this happens, the LED strip on the driver console lights up bright red and the user needs to restart the code and recalibrate the stick (unplug and plug back in, hit F1). This code also has an implementation of the [PulsedLight LIDAR-lite](https://engineering.purdue.edu/477grp7/datasheets/lidar.pdf) module, and changes the colors of the driver station LEDs according to the distance, which helps us line up at the human feeder station.

## Team 3620: The Average Joes (Java/Command-Based)

> Most of the code is pretty typical FRC code (complete with warts). There are a few unusual things in there, though, that other teams may find useful:
> 
> * event logging.
> * data logging.
> * UDP transmission of JSON encoded data to an onboard co-processor.
> * UDP reception of JSON encoded data from an onboard co-processor.
> * adding third party jars to the build.

> The first link is a link to a Git repo that has the 2015 off-season work we did where we took the 2015 robot code and generalized it. It works well and will spin motors and read joysticks and sensors...but there is still some more work we want to do with it. As we make improvements we will continue to make releases.

## Team 4761: The Robockets (Java/Command-Based)

> Our robot specialized in capping stacks of boxes with the recycling cylinder to get maximum points. This code features some interesting bits that were later turned into their own separate libraries, like the [sensors package](https://github.com/Team4761/2015-Robot-Code/tree/master/src/org/usfirst/frc/team4761/robot/sensors) and the [button management system](https://github.com/Team4761/2015-Robot-Code/blob/master/src/org/usfirst/frc/team4761/robot/ButtonManager.java). There is also the [gyro code](https://github.com/Team4761/2015-Robot-Code/blob/master/src/org/usfirst/frc/team4761/robot/sensors/GyroSensor.java) which adds some support for the I2C powered MPU-6050 gyro. It is in the command-based structure and pretty well documented so go start exploring!
